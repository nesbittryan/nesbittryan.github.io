                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-envelope"></span>What Did I Do?</h2><hr>
                    <p class="hmt" style="text-align:left;">My position at Trans Plus was a Software Developer. After my first coop term, this role was a very similar fit. I was a member of
                        the scrum team, completing defects in the code as well as complete features for the product. I was able to jump in very quickly, as I was already familiar with using C#,
                        which the products I worked on were mostly comprised of. Over the course of my term, I completed a feature which allowed users to quickly geocode (add a geo coordinate from a provider
                        such as google) locations automatically instead of manually selecting each one. I also completed over 100 defects over my weeks there. I also did a lot of refactoring, reformating, style and
                        documentation changes as I was working on this coop, as a lot of the code I was working on was years old. This helped me get some experience in architecture and design, as I could examine
                        the design decisions the team has done and used over the years, and was able to see the positives and negatives of them. The defects I worked on also spanned into other scopes of the application,
                        which led me to greatly improving my SQL knowledge, as well as introducing me to Crystal Reports.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-envelope"></span>What Did I learn?</h2><hr>
                    <p class="hmt" style="text-align:left;">The biggest thing that I have gained from this position is the experience with working with an older codebase. My previous coop was on a product that hadn't been
                        released yet, so there wasn't as much pressure on the aspects like bug fixes and complexity in the system, since it was all relatively new. On this job, I had to delve deep into functions that were
                        created a decade ago, into files 10's of thousands of lines long. This required me to use skills at a much higher level, like problem solving, finding the sources of problems, and figuring out why a
                        defect was caused, and trying to determine if it was a mistake or if there was a reason it was coded in that way.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p class="hmt" style="text-align:left;"> At this new job I was fortunate enough to learn a lot about using SQL. From manipulating data to play with, to fixing defects in stored
                        procedures, to adding new fields and changing existing fields, I had a lot of exposure with SQL. This was one of the goals I had for this term also, so I am very happy I was
                        able to get hands on experience with it. I also learned how to create and print reports using Crystal Reports from SQL stored procedures. These reports take in parameters that can
                        be set to match a specific procedure, allowing you to easily get the data from your database and onto the report.
                    </p>
                    <br><br>
                    <h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-envelope"></span>My Goals...</h2><hr>
                    <p class="hmt" style="text-align:left;">I started this co-op term with three goals, and I have accomplished all of them.
                        <li class="list-group-item"><p>
                        The first goal I had was to continue to be a vocal member of the scrum team. In my last role, I started off a very shy employee, and gradually opened as I felt more
                        confident and comfortable with the team. This term, I didn't want to take any steps back, and open up right away. I also wanted to interact more with my coworkers, getting more
                        connections on LinkedIn as well as more playful office banter. I have succeeded in this goal, because right from the start I was vocal in our bi-weekly stand up meetings. I also have developed
                        better relationships at this term, as since the development team was smaller, and sitting closer together, we often delved deep into random discussions that ranged from philosphical dilemnas, to statistical
                        problems, to the physics and rules behind a worldwide groundhog day (the movie, not the holiday). We also cooked a lunch for the whole office, and made some pretty amazing chinese food for a bunch of
                         computer nerds! As a whole, I felt a lot closer with this team, and it was a lot more bittersweet this term when it was ime to end the term.
                        </p></li>
                        <li class="list-group-item"><p>
                        My second goal was to focus more on the architecture, structuring, and design of code. At my first time, I didn't really get much chance to look into the designing of the code, as I spent a lot of the time
                        just learning the new language and how to use it. I got to get experience with this by sitting in some meetings about designing new features. One of these was for a geocoding service which I created. This
                        helped me to understand what all goes into making new features, as you must think about many things when designing code, from the maintainability, performance, complexity and many more things. I also spent a
                        lot of time refactoring old code in order to improve the design of it, and to improve the stability, readability, and ease for future developers to interact with it. This was something I really enjoyed doing,
                        as I could see the benifit I was leaving for the future development team.
                        </p></li>
                        <li class="list-group-item"><p>
                        My final goal this term was to improve my SQL skills. As I've touched on previously, I've gotten a lot of experience in SQL this term. This was an important goal to me because I know a lot of
                        jobs really on SQL and it is important to improve my employability. Specifically in this term, I've gotten first hand experience creating and modifying Stored Procedures. I've become aware of the
                        differences and uses of Functions versus Stored Procdures. I've also seen how to maintain coherence between versions of the software, and to make sure different data base updates don't break when clients
                        are updating live. I also was tasked with created update scripts using Visual Studio to update clients, and to make sure they didn't lose any data or scripts they had in their databases. These comparisons
                        were useful as it let me see a side of the SQL I hadn't previously, as I used to just use the 'front end', just a user of it that didn't know everything that was involved in it.
                        </p></li>
                    </p>
                    <br><h2><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-envelope"></span>Conclusion</h2><hr>
                    <p class="hmt" style="text-align:left;">
                        This term was a great learning experience for me. While my first term was a great introduction into everything to do with being a Software Engineer, this term helped me to refine all of the skills. I
                        was able to improve my vocal communication through Stand-Up meetings and interacting with the team more often. I improved my technical abilities in C# while creating extension methods, refactoring old code,
                        and creating new features and functionality. I learned about the processes behind creating and designing software, as well as seeing many do's and dont's from code that has been crafted many years ago.
                        I am very thankful for how I was accepted into this team, and all of the people here who helped my development as a developer. Everyone there help contribute to my growth as a person either through
                        overhearing conversations, reviewing my code and helping see flaws in my work, and even just approving my suggestions and helping to increase the confidence I have in my abilities. I look forward to possibly
                        seeing this team again, and hope everyone has an opportunity to work with a team as talented and fun as this one.
                    </p>
