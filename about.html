                    <h2 class="hmt">Background:</h2><hr>
                    <p class="hmt">I grew up in a small town in Mid-Western Ontario, Canada with a population of less than
                    1000 people. This upbringing instilled small town values, such as a good work ethic, communicating
                    with your community, and a sense of pride for the communities you are a part of. I am the oldest sibling to one sister,
                    and two loving parents who gave me the oportunity to do what I wanted to do. I wasn't too sure what I was going to do after
                    attending high school. I decided on computer science, and I've been happily programming since.</p>
                    <br><h2 class="hmt">Education:</h2><hr>
                    <p class="hmt">Graduated F.E Madill High School as an Ontario Scholar, and am currently attending
                    the University of Guelph. I am getting my Bachelor of Computing, Major. Software Engineering (Co-Op).
                    I have not yet chosen an area of application, but have taken many electives relating to Psychology and
                    Economics. My best courses have been Object Oriented Programming (CIS*2430), Digital Systems I (CIS*3120) and
                    Software Systems Development and Integration (CIS*2750). I am experienced in the following languages (but not limited to):

                    <br><h2 class="hmt">Interests:</h2><hr>
                    <p class="hmt">This section is dedicated to interests relating to my studies, other subjects will be in the next section.
                    I have a strong interest in understanding artificial intelligence, and have taken classes in Behavioural Neuroscience to
                    further increase my knowledge. Another interest I have recently uncovered is creating hardware circuits, as I have done in
                    Digital Systems. I enjoy playing around with new technologies, such as but not limited to, Bootstrap, Regex, SQL, C#, SWIFT etc.</p>
                    <br><h2 class="hmt">Hobbies:</h2><hr>
                    <p class="hmt">I grew up playing a multitude of sports, many of which I still try to play and watch. These include a lot of hockey,
                    soccer, lacrosse and baseball/slowpitch. Keeping active is an important part of my life. I hit the gym every day, and believe proper
                    nutrition and excercise is necessary to maintain a healthy life. Most of my free time is divided evenly between cooking, working out,
                    playing with new languages/technologies, and playing video games. Primarily an Xbox One gamer, but hoping to get a gaming PC soon.
                    Favourite Games include Fallout series, Elder Scrolls series, Overwatch, Call of Duty series, and so many more great games I'm
                    forgetting.</p>
