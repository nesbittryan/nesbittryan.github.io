                    <p>I am a third year student at the University of Guelph, attempting to get my Bachelor of
                        Computing. My major is in Software Engineering, and I expect to graduate in 2020. This site is a roadmap of my experiences
                        throughout my different co-op jobs, as well as personal projects, and hopefully looks good doing it.

                    <h4>Who Are They?</h4><hr>
                    <p style="text-align:left;">Laborie is a leading company in the Urodynamics industry. Working for a company that deals with mostly urinary
                        products, this can lead to many interesting conversations. They are a global company, with a software team in Mississauga, Ontario, and Enschede,
                        Netherlands. Besides these two software teams, Laborie also develops, creates, and produces all of its own products. They even sell consumables
                        and disposables used during urodynamic procedures. Despite being a huge company, the company atmosphere prevents you from getting lost in a sea
                        of people. The people I worked with were excellent people, whether I was skyping them over the ocean, or defeating them on the ping pong table.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>What Did I Do?</h4><hr>
                    <p style="text-align:left;">My official job title was an Associate Software Developer, and this acurately describes what I got to do. I was
                        lucky to get plenty of hands on experience developing code. I was doing the same job as the other Software Developers on the team, completing User
                        Stories (in an agile developing environment), fixing bugs, writing unit tests for my code, gathering and refining requirements and continually learning
                        new skills. My favourite part was jumping into a new programming environement, with no experience in the OS (developing on Windows, I use a Mac), no
                        experience in the IDE (Visual Studios), no experience in the languages used (C# with XAML), and no experience in this Scrum developing methodology.
                        The fact I was able to jump in, learn what to do, and complete my assigned tasks (and much more), really helped me improve my confidence in my code.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>What Did I learn?</h4><hr>
                    <p style="text-align:left;">This opportunity increased my technical abilities immensely, but my soft skills improved much more. I came in as a
                        nervous, quiet student, who was always scared his code was going to fail the test. I remember completing my first bug and how scared I was to even ask
                        someone to look at my solution! I don't think I said a word for the first two weeks of the daily stand-up meetings! By the time my work term was done,
                        I was completing on average of 2 stories per sprint, I resolved half of the teams total closed bugs, I was awarded (the coveted) Caped Coder award for
                        3 out of the 5 sprints (most of any co-op student) I participated in (Caped Coder is a "Sprint MVP", voted on by the software team. The reward is a
                        superhero cape for your office chair). I was the most vocal person in the Stand-ups (to the dismay of others),
                        and tried to help others complete their stories when I had any free time. This term has solidified in my mind that I have chosen the right career path to
                        pursue
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p style="text-align:left;">I also learned about new technologies and got experience to strengthen my current knowledge. Specifically, I dealt with
                        C# and XAML WPF applications for windows, and am very comfortable creating applications using these now. I also got to expand upon my current SQL knowledge,
                        helping me expand my full-stack developing experience. I also used the Model-View-ViewModel method of architecture, a method that keeps the UI and the business
                        loosely coupled, to allow for easy swapping, testing, and refactoring of code. I also found out about many new online resources, the biggest one being PluralSight.
                        This website offers videos and MANY topics, and was instrumental in helping me learn the new frameworks and languages I needed.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>My Goals...</h4><hr>
                    <p>I started this co-op term with four goals, and I have accomplished all of them.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li class="list-group-item"><p>
                                My first goal was to improve my personal and time
                                management/organization. In the past I have struggled with keeping my projects and tasks organized, and I accomplished them at Laborie by keeping a journal which I would
                                use to not only take notes, but to list my daily activities. This helped me get everything I needed to do prioritized and prevented me from forgetting any tasks.
                            </p></li>
                            <li class="list-group-item"><p>
                                Another goal I had was to improve my overall development ability by learning to develop a new technology on a new system. I did this by learning to develop for a new platform (Windows, coming
                                from a Mac background) and WPF Applications in C#. This goal was important to me because showing I can learn a new technology quickly, and develop on any system will be a great
                                asset to any future employers.
                            </p></li>
                            <li class="list-group-item"><p>
                                My third goal was to make connections with my co-workers to expand my network, and also my knowledge by learning from their experiences in the field.
                                In my time, I have added many of my co-workers on LinkedIn, got offered to have letters of recommendation from multiple people, and was offered a job in the future if I was looking again.

                            </p></li>
                            <li class="list-group-item"><p>
                                My final goal was to increase the readability of my code by other people. Looking back at my old projects, a lot of my code wasn't heavily documented. I changed this with this position,
                                as I knew once I was gone people might need to look and update some of my code. I left it with comments, and this was with the help of StyleCop, a plugin that tells you when your
                                style has problems, which includes comments for things like files, methods, and classes. Overall I am very happy with all of my goals, and am happily surprised that I did so well.
                            </p></li>
                        </ol>
                    <br><h4>Conclusion</h4><hr>
                    <p style="text-align:left;">In conclusion, I wish this term didn't have to end. I would of loved to work here for another term, but the travel time/cost
                        was too much for me (Guelph -> Mississauga). I met plenty of great people, that were very helpful and taught me things covering a variety of subject areas.
                        Laborie gave me an excellent environment where I felt safe to express myself, and I felt like my opinion was valued. Hopefully my path will cross with them again
                        in the future! I'd like to end this post by recommending their products, as they're an excellent company, but I hope that my readers aren't in a position where they need them.

            <br><h2 class="hmt">Education:</h2><hr>
            <p class="hmt">Graduated F.E Madill High School as an Ontario Scholar, and am currently attending
                the University of Guelph. I am getting my Bachelor of Computing, Major. Software Engineering (Co-Op).
                I am also getting a minor in Psychology as it is an area of interest for me.
                My best courses have been Object Oriented Programming (CIS*2430), Digital Systems I (CIS*3120) and
                Software Systems Development and Integration (CIS*2750). I am experienced in the following languages (but not limited to):

            <br><h2 class="hmt">Interests:</h2><hr>
            <p class="hmt">This section is dedicated to interests relating to my studies, other subjects will be in the next section.
                I have a strong interest in understanding artificial intelligence, and have taken classes in Behavioural Neuroscience to
                further increase my knowledge. Another interest I have recently uncovered is creating hardware circuits, as I have done in
                Digital Systems. I enjoy playing around with technologies like Angular, Bootstrap, Regex, SQL, etc.</p>
            <br><h2 class="hmt">Hobbies:</h2><hr>
            <p class="hmt">I grew up playing a multitude of sports, many of which I still try to play and watch. These include a lot of hockey,
                soccer, lacrosse and baseball/slowpitch. Keeping active is an important part of my life. I hit the gym every day, and believe proper
                nutrition and excercise is necessary to maintain a healthy life. Most of my free time is divided evenly between cooking, working out,
                playing with new languages/technologies, and playing video games. I play video games on both the Xbox One and PC.
                Favourite Games include Fallout series, Elder Scrolls series, Overwatch, Call of Duty series, and so many more great games I'm
                forgetting.
