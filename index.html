The only negative about my time here was having to spend hours driving between the Mississauga office, and my house in Guelph. Here I greatly increased my confidence, as well as sharpened my ping pong skills.

I was using C# and XAML to create a windows application using the WPF subsystem of the .NET framework. I also got my first experience with SQL, which was one of my goals for this term. I learned a lot on this term, and I had a lot of fun with the corporate culture Laborie had to offer.</p>
